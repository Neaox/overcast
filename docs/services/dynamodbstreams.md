# DynamoDB Streams — Amazon DynamoDB Streams

Every write to a stream-enabled table produces a change record. A stream has one
shard, and its records are never trimmed.

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial

## Quick start

```bash
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566

aws dynamodb update-table --table-name orders \
  --stream-specification StreamEnabled=true,StreamViewType=NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES
ARN=$(aws dynamodbstreams list-streams --query 'Streams[0].StreamArn' --output text)

SHARD=$(aws dynamodbstreams describe-stream --stream-arn "$ARN" \
  --query 'StreamDescription.Shards[0].ShardId' --output text)
ITER=$(aws dynamodbstreams get-shard-iterator --stream-arn "$ARN" \
  --shard-id "$SHARD" --shard-iterator-type TRIM_HORIZON \
  --query ShardIterator --output text)
aws dynamodbstreams get-records --shard-iterator "$ITER"
```

Any credentials work; with none configured, run `eval "$(overcast env)"` first
— see [Using AWS SDKs and CLI](../sdk-cli.md#credentials).

## What works

| Area | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| View types | `KEYS_ONLY`, `NEW_IMAGE`, `OLD_IMAGE` and `NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES` all produce the images AWS documents |
| Iterators | `TRIM_HORIZON`, `LATEST`, `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` and `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` |
| Consumers | Lambda event source mappings and EventBridge Pipes poll table streams |
| Regions | A stream belongs to its table's region, and every record carries `awsRegion` |
| Protocols | AWS JSON 1.0 on the shared root endpoint, and Smithy RPC v2 CBOR |

## Differences from AWS

| Area                  | On AWS                                                  | Overcast                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shards                | Split as throughput grows, with parent/child lineage    | One per stream, its id derived from the table name and never rolling over, so splitting and traversal cannot be exercised       |
| Trimming              | Records are discarded after 24 hours                    | Records survive for the life of the table, so `TRIM_HORIZON` always replays from the first write                                |
| Region-scoped ARNs    | A regional endpoint refuses another region's stream ARN | `DescribeStream` and `GetShardIterator` answer `ResourceNotFoundException` the same way                                         |
| Cross-region triggers | Streams and their consumers are region-scoped           | A Lambda event source mapping or pipe naming one region's stream is not fired by writes to a same-named table in another region |
