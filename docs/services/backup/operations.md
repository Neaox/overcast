| `DescribeBackupVault`                   | ⚠️ Partial   | GET /backup-vaults/{BackupVaultName}; honours `backupVaultAccountId`. Vault lock and MPA approval are not emulated, so `Locked` is always false and the retention members are absent                                                                                                                                                                     | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_DescribeBackupVault.html)                   |

Every vault is a standard unshared vault, so `shared=true` lists none                                                                                                                                                                                              | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupVaults.html)                      |

| `GetBackupPlan`                         | ⚠️ Partial   | GET /backup/plans/{BackupPlanId}; only the current version is kept, so any other `versionId` is not found, and `MaxScheduledRunsPreview` yields no `ScheduledRunsPreview`                                                                                                                                                                                | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_GetBackupPlan.html)                         |

Plans are deleted outright rather than tombstoned, so `includeDeleted` adds nothing                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupPlans.html)                       |
| `UpdateBackupPlan`                      | ⚠️ Partial   | POST /backup/plans/{BackupPlanId}; mints a new VersionId per update.

| `CreateBackupAccessPoint`               | ⚠️ Partial   | PUT /backup-access-point/create (#1467); `Tags` is applied at create time. `AccessPointPolicy` is accepted and dropped — no access policy is enforced behind this control plane                                                                                                                                                                          | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_CreateBackupAccessPoint.html)               |

| `DescribeBackupAccessPoint`             | ⚠️ Partial   | GET /backup-access-point/{AccessPointArn}; returns the stored `AccessPointMetadata` verbatim. No recovery point exists to read `BackupVaultName`, `BackupVaultArn`, `ResourceArn` or `ResourceType` from, and no S3 access point is created, so those members and the metadata's `S3AccessPointArn`/`S3AccessPointAlias` are absent rather than invented | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_DescribeBackupAccessPoint.html)             |
| `ListBackupAccessPoints`                | ⚠️ Partial   | GET /backup-access-point; `MaxResults` and `NextToken` query params.

| `ListBackupAccessPointsByRecoveryPoint` | ⚠️ Partial   | POST /backup-access-point/recovery-point/{RecoveryPointArn}; filters on the ARN each access point was created against. No backup job runs, so no recovery point Overcast produced can ever be named here and the list is empty                                                                                                                           | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupAccessPointsByRecoveryPoint.html) |
| `ListBackupAccessPointsByResource`      | ⚠️ Partial   | POST /backup-access-point/resource/{ResourceArn}; an access point's `ResourceArn` is a property of its recovery point, which Overcast never creates, so nothing is ever stored for this to match and the list is empty                                                                                                                                   | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ListBackupAccessPointsByResource.html)      |
| `TagResource`                           | ✅ Supported | POST /tags/{ResourceArn}, shared with Pipes/EKS/Scheduler/AppConfig/API Gateway's ARN-dispatched path (#1195). Tags are stored inline on the vault, plan or access point record, so they die with it                                                                                                                                                     | [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_TagResource.html)                           |
