// registry_unavailable_test.go — "the registry did not answer" is not
// "the repository is empty".
//
// Nothing tells Overcast about a `docker push`, so an image record exists only
// because syncRepoImagesFromRegistry swept the registry when a client asked
// what a repository holds. When that sweep cannot reach the registry it has
// nothing to add, and the store it leaves behind looks exactly like the store
// of a repository nobody ever pushed to.
//
// Answering ImageNotFoundException off that store is wrong twice over. Real ECR
// reports a server-side failure as ServerException, never as a missing image;
// and cdk-assets reads a missing image as "publish this again", so a registry
// that was merely unreachable costs a Docker build and a layer upload per asset
// while reporting nothing. The registry being down is a fact worth saying out
// loud.
//
// repoRegistryState already draws this distinction for the delete path — see
// its comment, "only the first is grounds for deleting anything". These tests
// hold the read paths to the same line.
